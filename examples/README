			   SPGrove Examples

The following examples are listed in concept order, starting with the
first will lead into concepts in the later examples.

    visitor.pl
        A skeleton of the Visitor pattern.  Doesn't actually do
        anything visible.  Includes a description of the Visitor
        concept.

    simple-dump.pl
        Uses the visitor pattern to dump groves on standard output in
        an indented format, uses an extra argument to `accept' to hold
        context (well, `depth' anyway :-).

    my-html.pl, my-html.html
        Uses `accept_gi'/`visit_gi_NAME' to support adding new tags to
        HTML-like document instances.  This example in particular
        allows you to embed Perl code into HTML documents.  Uses
        Perl's AUTOLOAD in `my-html.pl' and ``CDATA marked sections''
        in `my-html.html'.
