Revision history for Perl extension SGML::SPGrove.

`*' indicates backward incompatible changes

0.16  Sun Dec 28 17:21:32 CST 1997
	- fixes
	  - fix argument evaluation order with token attributes

0.15  Sun Nov 30 21:17:18 CST 1997
	- Element doc: implied attributes are left undefined (i.e. no
	  hash entry in an element's attributes)
	* don't create attribute hash at all if only implied attributes
	- fixes
	  - fix missing token attributes
	  - BuilderBuilder: remove debugging statement that printed
	    newlines during grove to object tree transform

0.14  Sat Nov 29 21:34:23 CST 1997
	* Simple: `attr' renamed to `attr-as-string', `attr' now
	  copies array of scalars and entity refs.
	* inhibit error messages going to stdout (this is not exactly
	  backward incompatible, but it sure can be awfully confusing
	  to no longer see error messages)
	- fixes
	  - shouldn't leak memory so badly (at all??)

0.13  Thu Nov  6 13:20:13 CST 1997
	- added first cut SGML::Writer to write groves
	- fixes
	  - BuilderBuilder: push only delegates, not Iters

0.12  Mon Nov  3 11:32:22 CST 1997
	* change visit type names:
		visit_grove	visit_SGML_SPGrove
		visit_element	visit_SGML_Element
		visit_sdata	visit_SGML_SData
		visit_pi	visit_SGML_PI
	* Element: attributes may now be a notation or an array of
          entity references as well as an array of data/sdata objects
	* simple-spec.dtd, Spec, SpecBuilder, BuilderBuilder: add
	  `use-gi' and `copy-id'
	* BuilderBuilder: moved `no_gi' argument to spec
	* visitors must now support visit_SGML_Entity,
          visit_SGML_ExtEntity, visit_SGML_SubDocEntity
	- implement `cdata_mapper' and `sdata_mapper' in `as_string's
	- SPGroveNew: support Notation, Entity, ExtEntity, SubDocEntity
	- updated examples visitor.pl, simple-dump.pl, my-html.pl
	- SPGrove.pm, Element.pm, and SData.pm now use Class::Visitor
	- added `DOM' document relating SPGrove to W3's Document Object Model
	- SPGrove can now have multiple elements, `root' returns the first
	- fixes
	  - SpecBuilder: no longer trys to parse arguments in `<CODE>'

0.08  Sun Oct 19 16:22:45 CDT 1997
	- SPGrove now concatenates consecutive data, *much* faster
	- remove AutoHash, move to use Class::Visitor
	- fixes
	  - accept_gi converts non-perl characters to `_' in visit_gi_GI
	  - SpecBuilder converts REs to newlines (fixes bug with comments)

0.07  Sun Oct 12 16:28:00 CDT 1997
	- AutoHash::new now creates $self from arguments
	- added `as_string' to AutoHash
	- added `ignore' element to simple specs
	- added `new' to SData
	- added `scaler' and `sdata' queries in specs
	- BuilderBuilder now takes keyed arguments, adding `no_gi' to
	  create builders without using `visit_gi_'
	- fixes
	  - SData->data was returning $self
	  - AutoHash's `accept' only created in superclass
	  - Element deref'd child but then didn't use it
	  - Element and SpecBuilder convert wierd chars to `_' (still
	    not complete, though)
	  - BuilderBuilder: moved `visit_scalar' and `visit_sdata'
	    ``up'' to `NoSuchGI_' so builders can override.
