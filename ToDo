 * get feedback from developers (that's YOU!) on what they need most

Otherwise,

 * bugs
  ** Simple: not recording errors
  ** doesn't handle non-SGML chars
  ** RPM spec doesn't work with Perl 5.004 MakeMaker

 * functionality
  ** record ends are carriage returns
  ** SimpleSpec: cascading specs
  ** create test suite
  ** do more useful things with Entitys
  ** Writer needs more intelligence

 * SP
  ** no events for undefined entities in XML
  ** not recognizing <.../> empty elements, nesting instead (use jade1_0?)

 * projects
  ** Unicode
  ** create Document Object Model <http://www.w3.org/DOM/> layer
  ** more examples

 * issues
  ** should SData be CharEntity or not even a special case of Entity?
