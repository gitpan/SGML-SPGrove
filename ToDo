 * get feedback from developers (that's YOU!) on what they need most

Otherwise,

 * bugs
  ** Perl comments in Specs don't work because REs are CRs
  ** Simple::Spec: handle element names with special characters

 * functionality
  ** SPGroveNew: complete ESIS
  ** AutoHash: borrow more from Class::Template (build more Perlish objects)
  ** Simple::Spec: better support for scalar, array, and hash elements
  ** exception handling
  ** record ends are carriage returns

 * performance
  ** SPGroveNew: build arrays locally
  ** AutoHash: re-implement `visit_PACKAGE'

 * SP
  ** no events for undefined entities in XML
  ** not recognizing <.../> empty elements, nesting instead (use jade1_0?)

 * projects
